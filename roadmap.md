### Step-by-Step Guide to Building the App

#### 1. **Setting up the Project**
   - Choose a tech stack (e.g., React Native for the app, Node.js/Express.js for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database).
   - Initialize your project and set up your development environment.

#### 2. **Authentication**
   - Implement user registration and authentication (sign up, login, logout, password reset, etc.).
   - Use JWT tokens for session management.
   - Ensure secure password handling with hashing (e.g., bcrypt).

#### 3. **User Management**
   - Develop User model and APIs for profile management.
   - Implement friend request functionality to handle sending, accepting, and blocking friend requests.
   - Create UI for managing friend lists.

#### 4. **Question and Prediction Handling**
   - Develop models and CRUD APIs for questions and predictions.
   - Implement functionality for creating questions and making predictions.
   - Ensure predictions are locked after submission and cannot be edited.

#### 5. **Reveal Mechanism**
   - Implement the reveal mechanism which allows revealing predictions based on time expiry or user votes.
   - Create UI to show predictions once revealed.

#### 6. **Real-time Features**
   - Use websockets (e.g., Socket.io) for real-time updates so users can see when predictions are revealed.
   - Implement live notifications for friend requests, question sharing, and reveals.

#### 7. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for your backend and frontend components.
   - Perform integration tests to ensure all parts of the system work together seamlessly.

#### 8. **Deployment**
   - Set up a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Heroku) for deploying your backend and database.
   - Use a CI/CD pipeline for smooth deployments (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins).

#### 9. **Security**
   - Ensure all data is transmitted over HTTPS.
   - Implement rate limiting and input validation to protect against DDOS and injection attacks.
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

#### 10. **User Interface & Experience**
   - Focus on providing a responsive and intuitive UI.
   - Implement UX best practices for ease of use, especially around key features like creating questions, making predictions, and social interactions.

#### 11. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - Integrate tools like Google Analytics to track user interaction.
   - Set up monitoring and logging (e.g., with New Relic or ELK Stack) for application health and performance.

#### 12. **Feedback and Iteration**
   - Launch a beta version to collect user feedback.
   - Iterate based on feedback to refine features and fix bugs.
